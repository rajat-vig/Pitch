Our mission is to make it simple for you!
 

 
Rajat Vig, thank you for choosing Jamboree!
 
We are delighted to have you prep with us!
At Jamboree, we take your test prep very seriously. With your effort and our guidance, we are certain to get you your desired score. We also want to emphasize the importance of not losing sight of your final goal; which is to get admission into the university  best suited for you and your career plan. Your applications are as important as, if not more important than, your test scores and we urge you to start thinking about them as soon as you start your test prep.

Students find the applications phase much more challenging than the test prep itself. Keeping that in mind, we have made exhaustive admissions packages for our students. We allocate one Expert Resource to start working on your applications parallel to your test prep. The packages include:

University Selection: Identifying the right universities for you based on your profile, your preferences, your budget and the admission records of our students from past years. We will give you a list of 15-20 universities and rate your chances of admission to each one. Your admissions counselor will then help you further zero down to the exact number of schools that you are planning to apply to.
Helping you identify your Recommenders
Editing your Letters of Recommendation
Building the contents of your Essays and Statement of Purpose
Preparing your Résumé and Profile building
Helping you prepare all your documents which include application forms, financial aid applications, transcripts, and financial documents
Reviewing your online application
Comprehensive and rigorous interview training: We will give you university-specific interview training.
Providing you with Value Added Services such as insurance, discounted couriers, educational loans, discounted foreign exchange, ticketing and much more.
We see an acceptance rate 7x higher than when students apply on their own. Since the combination of test prep + applications assistance has proven to be more fruitful for our students in the past, we encourage our new students to take the test prep + applications assistance package by offering 10% off on our Admissions Counseling. This offer is valid till 30 days after your enrollment date.
